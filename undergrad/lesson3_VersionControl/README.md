## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. A Version Control System is a system that records changes to a file or set of files so that you can recall specific versions later.
2. Git is a distributed version control system that is designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
3. To obtain a Git repository you can either take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository, or you can clone an existing Git repository from elsewhere.
