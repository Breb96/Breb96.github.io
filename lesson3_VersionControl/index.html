            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A Version Control System, also known as Revision Control or Source Control Management, is a system that records changes to a file or set of files so that you can recall specific versions later. Just to name a few things, it allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and many more things. There are three different types of version control systems: Local, Centralized, and Distributed. This topic interests me because before taking this course, I never knew about Version Control Systems and everything dealing with it. This topic is relevant to the course because we will be using GIT, which is a free distributed version control system.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Before Git was created, there was a proprietary distributed version control system called BitKeeper that Linux Kernel used. Git was created back in 2005 by the Linux development community. The Linux development community created Git because their relationship with the company that created BitKeeper ended. According to the article, there were five goals that the Linux development community had for their new system: speed, simple design, strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches), fully distributed, and able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size). This topic is interesting to me because if it wasn’t for the relationship ending between the two companies, then Git would not have been created at all or when it was created. This topic is relevant to the course because we would probably be using BitKeeper rather than Git. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">According to the PowerPoint, Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. The way that Git thinks about its data is a major difference between Git and other Version Control Systems. According to the article, Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots. Being that most operations in Git only need local files or resources to operate, the user is able to do just about anything while offline or off VPN. Using Git is a lifesaver because it makes it easier to restore versions that are saved for a project if something wrong or bad happens.  According to the article, Git has three main states that your files can reside in: committed, modified, and staged. This topic is interesting to me because it is amazing how one system can do so much and make life easier for its users. This topic is relevant to the course because we will be using Git to store our assignments that we are working on and we will more than likely need to be able to restore a specific version of a file if something isn’t working right or if something was done wrong in that version we can pinpoint it.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Getting a Git Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">According to the article, you typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways: you can take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository, or you can clone an existing Git repository from elsewhere. In either case, you end up with a Git repository on your local machine, ready for work. In order to initialize a repository in an existing directory one would need to go to that project’s directory first. After that step is done, a subdirectory containing all of the necessary repository files will be created named .git. In order to clone an existing repository, one would need the command git clone. With the git clone command, Git receives a full copy of what the server has. Also, when the git clone command is ran the history a project is pulled down, which includes every version of every file for that project. This topic is interesting to me because the commands to initialize and clone a git repository are not hard commands to learn. This topic is relevant to the course because we will need to know exactly how to initialize and clone a git repository.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Recording Changes to the Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">According to the article, each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: tracked or untracked. Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot that was taken by Git. These files can be unmodified, modified, or staged, and they are basically files that Git knows about. Untracked files are any other files in the working directory that were not in the last snapshot and aren’t in the staging area. When you first clone a repository, all the files will be tracked and unmodified because Git just checked them out and nothing has been edited. As you edit files, Git sees them as modified, because there have been changes since the last commit. As you work, you selectively stage these modified files and then commit all those staged changes, and the cycle repeats. This topic is interesting to me because I was unaware of the two possible states that my files in my working directory can be in. This topic is relevant to the course because we will need to be able to understand the difference between tracked files and untracked files.</p>
