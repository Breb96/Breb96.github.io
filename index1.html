        <h2><em>Overview</em></h2>

        <p>Huffington Post states that only 8% of people actually keep their New Year's Resolution and that moderating your resolutions could be the difference between giving up in February and creating a lasting lifestyle change.
        Living a healthy lifestyle is the change that most people want but some are unsure how to obtain it. </p>
        <p>It is quite simple, just follow the 80/20 rule. The 80/20 rule is 80% nutrition and 20% exercise as well as 100% mindset of course.
        Authority Nutrition enlightens us with what foods to eat in order to lose weight and in order to gain weight. </p>
        <p>Living a healthy lifestyle doesn't mean just looking fit, it is about being healthy mentally as well. It is best to stay positive about life and the things that you do in your life.
        If you look at living a healthy life as something that you are forced to do, then you will struggle on the journey and more than likely fail.
        To succeed, it is best to think of living a healthier lifestyle as something that will benefit you in a positive way.
        A few examples of ways that it can benefit you are you having more energy to do your daily tasks and anything extra that you would like to do, and boosting your self-esteem if you have low self-esteem. </p>
        <p>It can be very hard to stick to exercising on a regular basis as well as sticking to the proper nutrition, but it is all about your mindset.
        If you put your mind to it, then you can do anything. An article in Huffington Post shares 4 science-backed ways to motivate yourself to work out.
        The four ways are give yourself a real reward, sign a commitment contract, rethink positive thinking, and get paid.
        Another way that you can stay motivated is to take pictures every other month to see the results as the time goes by rather than going to the scale every week to check your weight.
        The scale can mislead you simply because, yes you are losing body fat, but you are also gaining muscle which will add weight.
        There will also be a time where you reach the "standstill point" where you may take a picture one month and take another picture the next month and you cannot see a difference.
        Accept it and continue to push through. If you start slacking on your nutrition, as well as your exercise, or one or the other, that's just fine, just find what motivated you to start your journey and get back to it.
        Just keep in mind that not everyone is going to have the same path as you. Some will go through their journey with no complications and others will go through countless complications, but it is all about your mindset to reach your goal.
